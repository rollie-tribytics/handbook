# Decisions

For new Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), please use one of the following templates as a starting point:

* [adr-template.md](adr-template.md) has all sections, with explanations about them.
* [adr-template-minimal.md](adr-template-minimal.md) only contains mandatory sections, with explanations about them. <!-- ### Consequences also contained, though marked as "optional" -->

The MADR documentation is available at <https://adr.github.io/madr/> while general information about ADRs is available at <https://adr.github.io/>.
